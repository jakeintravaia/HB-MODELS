# HB-MODELS
This repo contains the code necessary to create machine learning models capable of identifying 12-lead ECG signals using Physionets large scale 12-lead electrocardiogram database for arrhythmia study.  (https://physionet.org/content/ecg-arrhythmia/1.0.0/). It also include pretrained models for the HeartBuddy software suite.
